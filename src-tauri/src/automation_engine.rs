//! The Terminal Automations engine — plan `028`.
//!
//! One tap task, one evaluator task and one targeting tick for the whole engine — never one per rule.
//!
//! **The tap carries a signal, not data.** `state.terminal_screens` already holds a per-terminal
//! `vt100::Parser` fed every raw byte, unconditionally and losslessly, by the single authoritative
//! output consumer — before the lossy history filter runs. So the tap does exactly
//! `dirty.insert(payload.id, ())` and never reads `payload.data`, and the evaluator reads matchable
//! text from that parser. Three problems disappear together: a `ctx:5` | `0%` split across two chunks
//! is a non-issue because the parser is a state machine that spans `process()` calls; a
//! `RecvError::Lagged` costs a delayed evaluation rather than a missed match; and no new per-terminal
//! buffer exists, so there is nothing new to bound or leak. Plan §1.1.
//!
//! **Everything handed to `AppState` is a `pc-` process id; everything keyed here is the durable
//! `tm-` leaf**, converted at exactly one place. Never `state.resolve_ref` — it returns its input
//! unchanged when the leaf does not resolve, so it cannot double as an existence test and would hand a
//! `tm-` string to a `pc-`keyed map. Plan §7.4 holds the table.
//!
//! **M2 lands the pure core (extraction, comparison, the delta read, the arm machine) and M3 lands the
//! running loops.** M0 claims the name.
